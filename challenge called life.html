  <p>Historically mental illness has been ‘treated’ in a host of dangerous and sometimes horrifying ways. Around 7000 years ago trepanation was the treatment de jour. It was thought that mental illness was caused by evil spirits and could be cured by drilling small holes into the brain. While trepanation and other surgical methods such as lobotomies have unsurprisingly fallen out of favor, there is another approach – one that has been both celebrated and scorned over the last century:<h4>Psychotherapy.</h4> </p>
<p>Some of the benefits of psycological treatment include:</p>
<ul>
<li>– improvement of social attention, behavior, interpersonal interaction, and mood.
<li>– reduction of stress-related parameters such as cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure.
<li>– reduction of self-reported fear and anxiety.
<li>– improvement of mental and physical health, especially cardiovascular health.
</ul>

    <p > <h5>Depression is a mental health condition marked by an overwhelming feeling of sadness, isolation and despair that affects how a person thinks, feels and functions.  People with depression may experience a variety of symptoms, but most commonly, "a deep feeling of sadness or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities." Usually people with depression don't get medical help for their condition. Left untreated, major depression can set off a chain of social, emotional and health consequences that add to patients' overall stress.These include alcohol or drug abuse, anxiety, social isolation and relationship conflicts, work or school difficulties, or suicide.

  <p><h5 style="color: indigo">
   All human beings have something special within us and some weaknesses too. Not only they, we also do. The negativity surrounding the differently-abled can be overwhelming. We can get rid of this lonliness and negativity with a little bit of attention, a little bit of care, a liitle bit of love from the much more that we get every day.
 </h5> </p>

  <p><h5 style="color: coral">
    What they need is not sympathy, but understanding, along with a few words of appreciation. Sometimes offering them assisstance make them feel weak, make them feel as if they are "not sufficient". Instead trying to talk to them, trying to know their story, that story beyond "specially abled", that story that make them who they are.
  </h5></p>

  <p><h5 style="color: green">
   Presence of a environment where the differently-abled grow up with an array of creative opportunity is definitely necessary. There should be constant mental support to bring in the sense of "self-worth" in the place of "self-doubt".
